      <p>A Software developer proficient in JavaScript, Python and Java seeking positions in Front End/Full Stack Software Development. From Scotland but currently based in Niseko, Japan.
          A highly motivated software developer student, aiming to kickstart my career in a field that offers me the chance to be intellectually stimulated while continuing to develop my skills as a lifelong learner. 

          Chronically curious and globally minded, my drive to better understand and experience the world has led me to spend the last 10 years living abroad - starting in New Zealand and now living long term in Japan. 

          My desire to understand how things work first sparked my curiosity in software development, this then transformed from a desire to simply understand software to becoming a software developer myself. After 12 months of self-studying at home, I enrolled in CodeClan's Professional Software Development bootcamp in order to add more structure to my self taught learning. I am now seeking to transition into a career as a Software Developer.
